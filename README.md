# Capital-Recovery-Under-Lockdown
A Continuous Model of Reinvestment and Capacity

## Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant economic disruptions worldwide, with the regional lockdowns
impacting productivity and reinvestment in the period. As governments responded with a mix of short-term
and long-term investment strategies, understanding how capital evolves under these dynamic circumstances
with constrained resources became increasingly important. To explore this, we study a simplified dynamic
model of logistic capital growth that captures the effects of reinvestment under growth limitations, based on
an optimal economic control framework. We simplified the original model to a nonlinear differential equation
with a capital capacity to investigate the influence of the governmentâ€™s policies on a single region with varying
reinvestment behaviors over time. Our findings show that reinvestment interacts significantly with determining
how long regions can approach full economic recovery. This work demonstrates
